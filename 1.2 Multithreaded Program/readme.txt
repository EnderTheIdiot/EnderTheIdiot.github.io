1.2 Multithreaded Program : Instructions

When you run this program, two windows should appear on top of each other. 
(You may need to move the second window in order to see the first.)                                                                            

After the windows show "0.00" on-screen, the program is ready to use.

When you click either window, both windows should have their values increase.
The window will record every time you click it and display it.
(Keep in mind that clicking too fast may cause some clicks to go unrecorded.)

That's it. That is all it does.
Enjoy!

-= Project Information =-
This document gives a quick explination of the files of this project, how it works, and how to use it.


[INTERFACES]
For this project there are 3 main interfaces:

1. Data Entry Interfaces
Allows student information to be recorded in the same file. The infomation can be viewed and changed using this interface, but some
information cannot be changed with it, such as the "withdrawn" status and EDUID. 

2. End User Interface
Can view the students, but can now create or edit them

3. Admin Interface
Can view and change all student data. When you set a student's "withdrawn" status to "true", the information of that student will not be viewable 
by the other two interfaces

All information recorded by these interfaces are saved in the "students.info" file

The Student Class requires the following information:

- Required
Student Name
Student EDUID (Randomly generated and set upon student entry. Can only be modified by the Admin Interface)
Student ID
Student Grade
Student Date of Birth
Parent Name(s)
Parent Email
Parent Phone Number

- Required, but can only be viewed by the Admin Interface
Student Account Creation Date
Student Graduated Status
Student Withdrawn Status (Can only be edited by the Admin Interface)

- Extras

[OTHER]
The "AppendingObjectOutputStream" class is used to fix an issue that occurs when adding more students to the "student.info" file, where
the information becomes corrupted due to a "stream header" being incorrectly positioned. I fixed this issue later, but I didn't want to rewrite
a bunch of code, so I kept it as it is for the time being.

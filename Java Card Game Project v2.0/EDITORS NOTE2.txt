EDITORS NOTE 2

This is the note for Version 2.0

This update didn't take nearly as long, taking about 10 hours and 15 mins. The update wasn't as hard to make, but it still spent a lot of time adding around 250ish lines of new
code to make the program into a game of Blackjack!
I would like to state that if the program cannot find a certain file, it is due to submmiting the file to Github, and might need to be downloaded to fix the issue! (cause repositories can be weird)

Overall, I feel like making the game was pretty fun, and I hope other can enjoy it as well!

Happy Coding!

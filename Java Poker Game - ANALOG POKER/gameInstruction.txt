// GAME INSTRUCTIONS FOR: ANALOG POKER //

|GOAL|
In this game, your goal is to get the highest score possible by playing various poker hands, with each poker hand used providing
a mulitplier for your score. Your have a total of 3 hands that you can play during a run. ( basically a dump-down version of the 
rougelite poker+solitare game, Balatro ). 

|HOW TO PLAY|
To play, you simply run the program titled "mainGame.java", and enter the required inputs into the terminal when prompted. Also,
you will want to create a second window the file "gameUI.txt" opened up. This window will provide visuals to show you what cards
you have in hand, and the total score and hands you have left to play.

|CARD VALUES|
A = 14
K = 13
Q = 12
J = 11
X = 10 (TI had to use "X" instead of 10 due to an issue with the game UI generator)
All Numbered Cards = Same As Displayed Value

|HAND VALUES|
Flush = x5
Straight = x6
Pair = x2
Two Pair = x3.5
Full House = x5

|NOTES|
This score system isn't like normal poker or Balatro, rather, instead of having the highest rank card play for score, the score is
entirely based on the overal value of the played hand. 

It's possible I may change this program to work more like regular Balatro, but for the moment, this should meet the coding length
requirements for this assignments. This took me a decent chunk of time to get done, but thankfully this took way less time to put
together in comparision to the first time I made a poker-playing program. (Also, the code has a small bug where you can just enter
the same value multiple time, but using that would be cheating, so lets keep that a secret, k? (I'm sure i'll fix it at some point, 
but I need to get this turned in, so it will have to do for now))

1. [CHANGED] Made the "Victory!" message only play once per activation


// Code Review //

This program made by Vincent Adams is amazing! I only found two small bugs throughout the whole code, with one being a small issues with
the system printing "Victory!" a bunch of times when entering the finish point, and an issue with the backround music not playing, which
I believe is just an issue the format of the music file. It was very hard to find any major issues in this program, and it was very 
interesting to see how the program functions, and how they were able to make a working game in Java. Overall, I think that creator of
this program has done a fantastic job, and I am very impressed with the final result. 


// Solutions //

- Possible Solutions for "Victory!" Message Spam ([Player.java], Line 41)

1. (The solution that I added to my own copy of this program)

    if (new Rectangle(x, y, width, height).intersects(goal)) {
        victoryChecker += 1;
        if (victoryChecker == 1){
            System.out.println("Victory!");
        } 
    } else {
        victoryChecker -= victoryChecker;
    }


2. (Makes the program lag a bit)

    if (new Rectangle(x, y, width, height).intersects(goal)) {
        victoryChecker += 1;
        if (victoryChecker == 1){
            System.out.println("Victory!");
        } 
    }


- Possible Solutions (Music File Issue)

It looks like the file is still in the program's folder, but it doesn't seem to have
any data. This might have either been an error with the audio file conversion process,
or possibly and issue that occured when uploading it to the GitHub repository. I am not
sure how to fix the problem though, because the .wav file seems to be empty upon downloading
